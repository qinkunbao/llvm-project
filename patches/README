Building AOSP with the PAC Prototype
====================================

This prototype supports two possible targets:

1. An emulated device (FVP).
3. A hypervisor guest (Apple M1).

Building the compiler
---------------------

The compiler needs to be built against NDK r21 or later. This
prototype requires the use of the gn build system [1] to build the
compiler. Something like this args.gn should work:

clang_base_path = "/usr"
llvm_enable_assertions = true
llvm_targets_to_build = "all"
android_ndk_path = "/path/to/android-ndk-r21"

The script llvm/utils/frankendroid can be used to build and prepare a
gn-built compiler and builtins library to be used by the Android build
system. See the comments at the top of that file for how to use it.

Building the NDK libc++
-----------------------

Some operating system components are built against NDK libc++, so
its ABI needs to match. See aosp/ndk.notes for quick notes on how to
rebuild this component of the NDK.

Patching AOSP
-------------

Apply aosp/0001-PAC.patch to the root of your AOSP checkout with
"patch -p1". This patch applies cleanly to aosp/master as of:

Fri Sep 30 03:03:24 2022 +0000

with these patches applied:

https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/core/+/2239035
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3933186 (in external/angle)

Patching the kernel
-------------------

This prototype requires the use of the android-mainline or androidNN-5.15
kernel. This applies to both FVP and M1. Follow the normal target-specific
instructions linked below to rebuild the kernel, but it is not normally
necessary to do so.

Building AOSP
-------------

Set the TARGET_EXPERIMENTAL_PAC environment variable to any value
to enable the forward-edge PAC support.

Set LLVM_PREBUILTS_VERSION and LLVM_BINDGEN_PREBUILTS_VERSION to
the basename of your LLVM source directory. This is the name of the
subdirectory under prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86 that was created
by the frankendroid script.

Set ENABLE_CFI=false because this prototype is not compatible
with the software-based CFI used in Android.

Aside from that, follow the target-specific instructions.

For FVP, see https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:device/generic/goldfish/fvpbase/README.md
For macOS on M1, see https://github.com/google/android-emulator-m1-preview
but use the commands below to build the system image zip file:

lunch sdk_phone64_arm64-userdebug
m emu_img_zip

For Linux on M1, see README.cuttlefish

Running AOSP
------------

The resulting image should be fully functional with some
exceptions.

64-bit applications that use WebView and the PAC ABI will crash on
startup because WebView is provided as a prebuilt and therefore does
not conform to the PAC ABI. The WebView prebuilt will need to be
rebuilt and instructions for doing so will be provided at a later date.

Programs with Rust components may crash on startup because the Rust
compiler does not know about the PAC ABI. For now we disable PAC in
these processes via an ELF note; the long term solution is to teach
the Rust compiler to support the PAC ABI, for example by leveraging the
cross-language type identifiers proposed as part of:
